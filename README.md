# Party Planner To Do List

#### A MySQL Full-Stack Party Planning to do list to keep tabs on all those little things so necessary to planning a party with a very 90s internet design! 

#### Easily add a task, and decide if it's all set for that Saturday party, or still needs to be done. Added a task for that other party you were hoping to throw? Just delete it!

#### I tackled learning Handlebars and how it links with controllers and ORMs. I used an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to tell mySQL how to set up in the database and how to update, read, or delete.
